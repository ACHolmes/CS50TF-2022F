If `songs.db` contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Their music taste tends to be high in danceability and energy.

Hypothesize about why the way you've calculated this aura might *not* be very representative of the listener. 
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Here we've taken the average of some key musical traits, like energy and danceability. 
We might, though, get a better picture by identifying how frequently high-energy songs show up in this person's playlist. 
A handful of high-energy songs can increase the average artificially if they're not very frequently listened to. 
We might also take into consideration the ordering of the songs in the Top 100. 
Perhaps we weight the characteristics of songs that are higher in the list more than songs that are lower in the list, 
since those first songs are played more frequently.
