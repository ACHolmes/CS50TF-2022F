Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (10), the predictions varied widely. With a large number of predictions (up to 10000),
the predictions solidified with Belgium and Brazil as favorites. Other countries like Russia also appeared in the rankings
as the number of simulations increased, likely because Russia won some small number of the many simulated tournaments.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations. Since the time to run the program increases about 10x
afterwards, this might be the point at which we would call the predictions good enough.
